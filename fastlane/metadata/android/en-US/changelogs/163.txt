1. Reverted changes from build 161 because build 162 was out of sync and ended up based on commit bf484cb.
2. For tablets with a resolution of 1024x600, as well as for tablets with Android 3.x (because layout adaptation works best on 4.x), profiles and groups are forced to use the interface for phones.
3. In the settings, you can now disable splash screen when the application starts - this will save time.
